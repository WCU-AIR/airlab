I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, building upon my strong foundation as a software engineer. I worked as a software engineer for over 5 years at athenahealth. 

As a graduate assistant, my research interests focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with particular emphasis on Large Language Models and knowledge graph–based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) for scientific discovery. I am currently exploring how structured graph information can improve reasoning, explainability, and trust in LLM-powered systems. 

Previously, I have worked on projects such as an Ethereum-based blockchain application which is an award-winning organ donor matching platform, fine tuning T-5 Large for entity extraction, Novel Generator using LLM Agentic Framework and RAG Pipeline. As a Stanford University Innovation Fellow, I have conducted design thinking programs for students and professionals, blending technical expertise with creativity and problem-solving.

Outside of my academic life, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and appreciating mountain landscapes, especially alpenglow views. I also love mentoring others, exchanging ideas, and constantly seeking new challenges that help me grow both personally and professionally.
