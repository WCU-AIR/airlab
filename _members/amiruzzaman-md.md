I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at West Chester University. Prior to joining WCU, I worked as a software developer for almost 10 years for several companies. I have also held the position of Assistant Professor at Kent State University.

I have completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from National University. Along with that, I have completed four Master's degrees with my major in Computer Engineering in 2008 from Sejong University, Computer Science in 2011 from Kent State University (also, partly at Korea University) and Technology in 2015, also from Kent State University, and a Master's in Cybersecurity in 2023 from Georgia Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. degrees from Kent State University in 2016 (Mathematics Edu), 2019 (Evaluation and Measurement) and 2021 (Computer Science).

In the past, I have worked as a Research Assistant at Sejong University and Korea University. Alongwith that, I gained the opportunity to teach at both National University and Korea University. My research interests include Visual Analytics of urban data, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Hiding.
