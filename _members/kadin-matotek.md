I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, where I expect to graduate in May 2026. My research interests focus on Large Language Models (LLMs). I am particularly fascinated by the scientific side of computing, including designing experiments, analyzing results, and developing frameworks to evaluate complex systems.

As a research assistant, I have collaborated with Dr. Ngo, Dr. Amir, and fellow students on projects involving AI pipelines, large-scale testing on supercomputing clusters, and conference-level publications. I aim to continue in research after graduation, contributing to the understanding and development of intelligent systems.

Outside of academics, I stay active through ice hockey, ultimate frisbee, and hiking. I also enjoy traveling and relaxing with sci-fi shows like *Rick and Morty* and *Solar Opposites*.
