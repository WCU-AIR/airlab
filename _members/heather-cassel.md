I am currently a pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Anthropology at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. I expect to graduate in December 2027. My research so far has primarily focused on various uses for Large Language Models (LLMs). I am increasingly interested in expanding this type of research into the field of Foresnic Anthropology.

As a research assistant, I have worked with Dr. Ngo and other students from my university on projects involving LLMs, where my contributions have included data science and analysis.

In addition to my academics, I am currently working on developing an application for Forensic Anthropologists to use to make quick but accurate predictions based on bones (e.g. medicolegal significance, age at death) and build 'cases' for various individuals.

Additionally, I enjoy hiking and fishing to connect with nature and relax. I also love Halloween and relaxing with a cup of hot apple cider and some scary movies.
