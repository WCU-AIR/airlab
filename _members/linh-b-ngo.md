I am currently an associate professor in the Computer Science Department at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. Prior to my appointment with West Chester University in 2018, I worked as a Principal Research Facilitator with Clemson University's Research Computing and Data - Engagement Team where I provided support for high-performance computing and big data processing research projects on Clemson's Palmetto Supercomputer. During academic year 2023-2024, I took one year leave of absence from West Chester University to lead Drexel University Research Computing Facility as their Director of High Performance Computing.

Outside of work, I enjoy books, computer games, and sport, not necessarily in this order. I read a lot of books, but mainly in the science fiction and fantasy genres. Similarly, I play mostly RPG games, although I also enjoy turn-based strategies and FPS when my time is limited. Soccer and basketball have been my favorite activities since highschool.
