 I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Applied Statistics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania. I expect to graduate in May 2026. My academic interests include cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and cloud engineering.

My research experience includes a meta-analysis on blockchain consensus mechanisms completed in collaboration with Dr. Md Amiruzzaman and Dr. Linh Ngo. This work was accepted for publication and presentation at the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges. I am currently beginning a new meta-analysis examining the use of technology for Deaf individuals and its impact on accessibility, communication, and inclusion.

I am also helping form AiMD, a student organization focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science at WCU. The club aims to build a collaborative and inclusive space for students to learn, research, and develop meaningful AI and data-driven projects while strengthening technical and professional skills.

Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, yoga, and playing video games.
