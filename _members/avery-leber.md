I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a minor in Civic and Professional Leadership.  In the realm of computer science, I have areas of interest in network engineering and cybersecurity, and am currently experimenting with website design, software development, and Large Language Models (LLMs). I am expected to graduate in the Spring of 2028.

Presently, I am an executive member of the Women in Computer Science Club and leading a team of undergraduate students in a website renovation project for the Center for Connecting Kids LLC. I am also assisting Dr. Ngo and Dr. Amir in the research of applying LLMs to the field of robotics.

Outside of my academics, I spend my free time playing strategy-based video and board games, reading, writing, and fencing.
