I'm Ben C, a college student looking to enter software development, specifically full-stack web development.

I like to try a lot of things, from [modding games](https://bwc9876.dev/projects/ow-new-horizons) to building [websites](https://bwc9876.dev/projects/menagerie) and [desktop apps](https://bwc9876.dev/projects/ow-mod-man). I enjoy every aspect of software development. I first started programming with Unity games but then quickly began doing web development and then expanded into anything I was interested in. I'm currently in college majoring in Computer Science. I'm hoping to graduate in 2027 with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Professional Technical Writing.
