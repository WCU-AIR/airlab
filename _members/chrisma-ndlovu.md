I am Chrisma Ndlovu, a Computer Science major at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, graduating in Fall 2025. I hold a Qualys Certificate and have hands-on experience with SCAP scanning, alongside a strong foundation in software engineering, networking, and cloud security.

My projects range from building AI-powered grading systems to deploying enterprise-style IT environments with Proxmox and TrueNAS. I also enjoy exploring under-the-hood Linux internals and advanced networking concepts such as VLANs, routing, and firewalls.

In my free time, I play drums at Next Community Church, combining my passion for music with service. My long-term goal is to bridge technical innovation with everyday living by developing Home Management IoT servicesâ€”bringing together cloud, security, and automation to improve how people interact with their environments.
