I'm pursuing a master's degree in computer science at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, where my research explores how AI is reshaping computer science education and how we can shape pedagogy to improve learning outcomes. I'm also interested in resource-efficient computing. Previously, I earned my B.A. in computer science from Boston College and worked as a QA engineer.
