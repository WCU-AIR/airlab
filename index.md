The Artificial Intelligence Research (AIR) Lab at West Chester University explores how AI can transform education, computing, and human productivity. We explore the integration of local LLM agents, container-based infrastructures, and other AI-enabled systems into cohesive frameworks with a strong focus on reproducibility, accessibility, and student engagement. By combining technical innovation with pedagogical design, we develop open, scalable, AI-enabled frameworks that empower learners and researchers.
